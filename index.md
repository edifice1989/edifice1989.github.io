## Have Bioinformatics challenges or customized needs?

I am glad to help! Ideas are generated from meaningful discussion, please let me understand and solve your pain!

### A little about me: 
I finished my Ph.D training in Bioinformatics 2018. After that, I am a Bioinformatics Post-doc scientist at Stanford Research Institutue. I have extensive expertise designing novel algorithms to analyze and intergrate multi-omics Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, including exome, whole-genome, methylation, RNA-seq, proteomics. My computational contributions has been acknowledge as co-author and first lead author on top scientific journals, like Nature. You can find my full publication list at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7sbQFPIAAAAJ).

### Area of Expertise:
•	Computational biology doctoral training with a comprehensive background in programming and R statistics analysis, excellent presenter and published author 

•	3+ years industry experience and 5+ years in academia with a convincing track record of scientific innovation, resulted in 7 peer-reviewed publications on top scientific journals, such as Nature, with 800+ citations within past 5 years

•	Efficient in prototyping and building novel algorithmic tools, on local cluster and AWS cloud, to solve biological problems

•	Independent, self-motivated investigator and excellent communicator with 5+ successful collaboration experience across 4 institutes and multifunctional teams 


### Skillset:

•	Apply R packages to build statistical and analytic frameworks on big data produced from Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) technology

•	Parallel computing on thousands of CPUs & storage management of terabytes of data on High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster 

•	Proficient programming languages, i.e., Python, R, SQL, Perl, under Linux environment

•	Build bioinformatics tools deployed by Docker on local server and on Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud platform

•	Deploy machine learning algorithm to integrate multiple omic data from patients
